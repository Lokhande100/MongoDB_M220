Upserts vs. Updates

Sometimes, we want to update a document, but we're not sure if it exists in the collection.

We can use an "upsert" to update a document if it exists, and insert it if it does not exist.

In the following example, we're not sure if this video game exists in our collection, but we want to make sure there is a document in the collection that contains the correct data.

This operation may do one of two things:

    If the predicate matches a document, update the document to contain the correct data.

    If the document doesn't exist, create the desired document.
